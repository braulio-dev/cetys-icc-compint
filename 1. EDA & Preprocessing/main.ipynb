    "# Conjunto de datos: ***Students' Academic Performance (Jan. 2026)**\n",
    "> This dataset contains information related to students’ academic performance and key factors that may influence learning outcomes. It is designed for educational analysis, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and beginner-level data science projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "> The dataset includes a mix of quantitative data (such as academic scores and study time) and qualitative data (such as test preparation status and demographic attributes). This combination makes it suitable for practicing data cleaning, grouping, comparison of averages, and basic visualization techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "> The primary goal of this dataset is to help learners explore questions like how study habits relate to performance across subjects, or whether certain preparation behaviors are associated with higher scores. The data is easy to understand, well-structured, and ideal for use in classrooms, Kaggle notebooks, or self-study projects.\n",
